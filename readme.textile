h1. Why do you even care?

run.js runs code in a directory and reruns it if any files are changed.
This makes it super easy to your code, and alt-tab to the terminal to see the results (or alt-tab to the browser and skip the terminal :)

h2. Show me how I use it

<pre>$ node path/to/run.js server.js

Starting: server.js
watched files:
./404.html
./index.html
./jqserve.js
./server.js
> server is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080</pre>

usage: node run.js yourcode.js

h2. Misc

You can also ignore changes to files that don't matter (like .DS_Store or whatever else)
