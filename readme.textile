h1. What does it do?

<pre>npm install run</pre>

<pre>$ run server.js

Starting: server.js
watched files:
./404.html
./index.html
./jqserve.js
./server.js
> server is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080</pre>

<code>run</code> will rerun server.js whenever one of the watched files is changed.

No more switching to the terminal to rerun your code. Just change a file and your code will be rerun.

This is especially nice for webservers, as you can skip the terminal and alt-tab to the browser to see your updated code happily running.

h2. Install

<pre>npm install run</pre>
