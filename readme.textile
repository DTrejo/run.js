h1. Why should I care?

run.js runs code in a directory and reruns it if any files are changed. 

No more switching to the terminal to rerun your code. Just change a file and your code will be rerun.

This is especially nice for webservers, as you can skip the terminal and alt-tab to the browser to see your updated code happily running.

h2. How does this even work?

<pre>$ node path/to/run.js server.js

Starting: server.js
watched files:
./404.html
./index.html
./jqserve.js
./server.js
> server is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080</pre>

h3. Misc

* You can also ignore changes to files that don't matter (like .DS_Store or whatever else)
* Usage: node run.js yourcode.js
